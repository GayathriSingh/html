            The Maldives is a republic lies south-west of the Indian sub-continent. It is made up of a chain of nearly 1,200 islands, most of them uninhabited.

            None of the coral islands stand more than 1.8 metres (six feet) above sea level, making the country vulnerable to any rise in sea levels associated with global warming.
            
            The economy revolves around tourism, and scores of islands have been developed for the top end of the tourist market.
            
            Its political history has been unsettled since the electoral defeat of long-serving President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in 2008
